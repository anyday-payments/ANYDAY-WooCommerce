Anyday WooCommerce plugin is is the official payment extension which provides support for Anyday payment gateway for store builders working on the WooCommerce platform.

== Description ==

Anyday is a truly free way for shoppers to buy now and pay later.

Shoppers can purchase for up to 5.000 DKK, and the credit line is recurring. This means they can start purchasing again as soon as installments have been paid.

With no costs and no fees for the shopper, Anyday guarantees a great shopping experience with no unpleasant surprises.

Anyday does not wish to contribute to overconsumption. Therefore, shoppers must pay 25 % of the purchase at checkout. This serves as the first installment. The remainder will be paid on the last banking day of the following 3 months.

Help your customers to a better shopping experience, while increasing your average order value.

Why wait until tomorrow? Offer Anyday today.
